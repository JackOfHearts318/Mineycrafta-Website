# Mineycrafta-Website
I'm having a lot of fun.
I'm better than you are, so I'll do the review.
You can shut up now. I'm always on duty.
Hmm. Do you have the game, Miney..Crafta? Penny told me she was playing it on her computer book. Let's play Mineycrafta.
Let's see. Hmmmm... oh yes, this is it! Mineycrafta!
Oh, Minecrap! I cannot wait to play Minecrap. Do you know what my favorite thing to do is in Minecrap? I love building bricks with Minecrap. Building bricks with Minecrap is the best thing and the most fun you can possibly have. I understand why all the kids are playing this game these days. It's because they like to build brown bricks with Minecrap. I ALSO like to build brown bricks with Minecrap. It is the most fun you can have while playing an app! What is the point of Minecrap?
Oh good! I love building sandcastles!
What kind of things can you build?
My deduction skills as a detective tell me that he has quite possibly, never had sex.
But, he is just copying a fake blueprint made by someone else. Seems a lot more like "monkey see, monkey do" than using creative energy if you ask me. He's a nerd, and I hate nerds more than I hate M.A.D Agents! What an asshole!
I have a robotic implant in my brain that lets me make 12,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second. I could rewrite the entire game's code, all while helping Penny with her homework and cleaning up Brain's doody.
*pew-pew pew-pew* I told you to shut up, but you didn't listen. Oh look, a free IPad.
